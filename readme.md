# üöÄ Building Applications with Vector Databases

Welcome to the **Building Applications with Vector Databases** project! This repository demonstrates how to leverage vector databases for various real-world applications, including semantic search, recommender systems, anomaly detection, and facial similarity search. Each application is accompanied by detailed examples and notebooks to help you understand and implement these techniques.

## üîç Application Details

### **Semantic Search**
- Transforms text into vector embeddings for conceptual similarity search.
- Utilizes **sentence-transformers** for accurate embeddings.
- Enables search based on meaning rather than keywords.

### **Recommender Systems**
- Generates content recommendations using vector similarity.
- Demonstrates collaborative filtering with vector embeddings.
- Includes real-world examples using news article data.

### **Anomaly Detection**
- Identifies unusual patterns in log data using vector embeddings.
- Visualizes similarity scores for easy interpretation of outliers.

### **Facial Similarity Search**
- Converts facial images to vector embeddings using **DeepFace**.
- Enables finding similar faces in a database.
- Includes dimensionality reduction for visualization.

## üìä Examples

Each notebook in this repository provides step-by-step guidance on:
- Setting up a vector database index.
- Encoding and storing vectors.
- Performing various search operations.
- Evaluating and visualizing results.
